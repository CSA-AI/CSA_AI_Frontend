    "- This Java program implements a perceptron, a basic type of artificial neural network used for binary classification tasks. It trains the perceptron on a small dataset with two input features and corresponding binary labels, adjusting its weights and bias to make predictions and classify new input data based on the learned pattern. Similarly this is how we would use a perceptron to recognize facial signals as a login."
