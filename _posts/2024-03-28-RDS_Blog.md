# RDS Blog

## 0. What is RDS? What can we use RDS for?

Amazon's RDS (Relational Database Service) "is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks". Essentially, it boils down to having a large database hosted in the cloud that can be accessed from anywhere, and can be scaled up or down as needed. You can probably tell by now that it seems like an amazing tool for hosting large amounts of info across multiple projects, and it very much is! RDS can handle up to 64TB of data, and can be used for a variety of applications, such as web applications, mobile apps, and even for data warehousing.

## 1. AWS RDS Setup

Before we can do anything further, we need to, obviously, setup RDS. Fortunately, here's a step by step guide:

### 1.a Getting Started
